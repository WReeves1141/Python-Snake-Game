# Python Snake Game
This is one of the projects I have made associated with the 100 days of code Python course by [AppBrewery](https://appbrewery.com).

## Run Guide
To run the program, python2/3 needs to be pre-installed on the machine. Once that has been completed follow these steps:
- Add a text file named "highscore" (with an integer value of '0' as the only character inside the text document) to the folder containing `main.py`.
- Open the folder containing `main.py` into a terminal and run the following command:
   - for python 3 use: `python3 main.py`
   - for python 1 or 2 use: `python main.py`
